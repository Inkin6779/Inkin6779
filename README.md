- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Inkin6779
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning on how to even code in the first place
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Use my socials, which you can find [here](https://inkin6779.github,io/Inkin6779/socials), but I prefer Discord/Reddit DM's.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: They/Them, or He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: This was created when I was 13 years of age
- Now... I do want to note that likely 99.9% of the repositories aren't mine, but show said creator in the repository (I thank GitHub for that) because I am using this for [Project School Stash](https://inkin6779.github.io/project-school-stash/).
