- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: They/Them, or He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: This was created when I was 13 years of age
I do want to note that likely 99.9% of the repositories aren't mine, but show said creator in the repository (I thank GitHub for that) because I am using this for Project School Stash (https://sites.google.com/view/project-school-stash/home)
